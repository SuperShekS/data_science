This was done as an assignment, hence I was limited by the areas, topics or models I could include in this review. 

But nontheless extensive work was done to show 
1.  EDA processes 
2.  Data visualization
1.  Hypothesis testing 
1.  BootStrapping 
1.  Story telling
1.  PCA
1.  and Model development
